# Unofficial Fitbit Client Library for PHP using OAuth2

Wholesale borrows large portions of [djchen/OAuth2-Fitbit](https://github.com/djchen/oauth2-fitbit) (minor change to
 error checking and scope handling) and [pavelrisenberg/fitbitphp](https://github.com/pavelrisenberg/fitbitphp).

Sets a fitbit-php-oauth2-state cookie during auth flow to prevent CSRF attacks. A session must be started beforehand.

Not guaranteed to work under any circumstances, but it's nice when it does.

## Installation

To install, use composer:

```composer require brulath/fitbit-php-oauth2```

## Usage

### Initialization

All below examples will assume a $fitbit is available. It currently is stateful, so you must set the correct token before
using it to make a request.

```php
$fitbit = new brulath\fitbit\FitbitPHPOAuth2([
    'client_id' => 'your_client_id',
    'client_secret' => 'your_client_secret',
    'redirect_uri' => 'https://www.example.com/fitbit/auth',  // must match URI specified in your app on the Fitbit Developer website
    'logger' => $log,
    'auto_request' => true,  // automatically redirect the user to the Fitbit OAuth process if a token doesn't exist
    'auto_refresh' => true,  // automatically refresh expired tokens
]);
$json_encoded_oauth2_token_for_user = getOAuth2TokenForUserFromMyDatabase();
$fitbit->setToken($json_encoded_oauth2_token_for_user);
$profile = $fitbit->getProfile();  // read warning below about token refreshes
print_r($profile);
```

### Token Refreshing Warning

OAuth2 tokens expire; sometimes they expire very quickly. In order to avoid having to manually acquire an updated token
from Fitbit, the library does so for you when it detects you attempting to perform an action on an expired token. The good
news is that this means you can be lazy regarding keeping tokens fresh, but the less good news is that you need to be vigilant
and grab the updated token when it changes.

There are two options for capturing token acquisitions:

#### Subscribe to a token-change event:
```php
$fitbit->on('obtain-token', function( [ $token ] ) {
    print("Acquired first token {$token} for the user; I'll save this to the database.");
});
$fitbit->on('refresh-token', function( [ $token ] ) {
    print("Acquired refresh token {$token} so I should update the database with this user's new OAuth2 token.");
});
```

#### Check post-request for token changes

If you do not wish to use events for some reason, you can check for the token after __every__ call you make to the API:
```php
$token = $fitbit->getToken();
if ($old_token != $token) {
    print("Acquired token {$token}.");
}
```

I'm lazy, so I've made this library automatically refresh oauth details whenever they've expired mid-call. That means
 after any call the oauth token may have changed, which you will need to check for (and save the new token). I figure
 it's probably easier to check for changed tokens than catching token expiration exceptions and handling those.
 Soz brah.
 
You have two options: checking ```$fitbit->getToken()``` after __every__ call, or subscribing to [events](http://sabre.io/event/).

```php
$fitbit->on('obtain-token', <your_token_saving_function>);
$fitbit->on('refresh-token', <your_token_saving_function>);
```
### Logging

If you want to follow automated events for debugging, grab MonoLog (or other) and pass an instance as 'logger' during initialization.

```bash
composer require monolog/monolog
```
```php
use Monolog\Logger;
use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;

$log = new Logger('name');
$log->pushHandler(new StreamHandler('path/to/your.log', Logger::WARNING));

$fitbit = new brulath\fitbit\FitbitPHPOAuth2([
    'logger' => $log,
    // etc.
]);
```

### Authorization

Authorization obtains OAuth2 keys for the Fitbit account in question. You must have a valid client id, client secret,
and redirect uri from the Fitbit developer website to use this library. You must specify all of the scopes you wish
to use here; you will need to re-authorize the user if you want to expand your scopes later.

#### Automated Authorization Flow

If you're lazy (hi!) you can have the library redirect the user to the Fitbit website for you.

```php
// A session is required to prevent CSRF
session_start();

$json_encoded_oauth2_token_for_user = $fitbit->getToken();  // will redirect user to fitbit ($fitbit->doAuthFlow()). the cookie it sets must survive.

echo "My Fitbit access token is: {$json_encoded_oauth2_token_for_user}";
```

#### Manual Authorization Flow

If you're lazy (hi!) you can have the library redirect the user to the Fitbit website for you.

Authorization involves sending the user to Fitbit's website with a 'state' code so we can verify the request came from us.
Store the state and send the user off to the uri.
```php
$auth = $fitbit->getAuthUrlAndState();
saveStateSoWeCanCheckItLater($auth['state']);  // $_SESSION['fitbit-php-oauth2-state'] = $auth['state']
redirectUserToFitbit($auth['uri']);
```

When the user returns to the redirect_uri specified on the Fitbit developer website, there will be a query ($_GET) parameter
set with the state we stored above; check they match to ensure the request originated with us.
```php
$state = retrieveQueryString('state');  // $_GET['state']
$storedState = retrieveStoredState();  // $_SESSION['fitbit-php-oauth2-state']
if ($state != $storedState) {
    throw \Exception("Invalid auth request");
}

$code = retrieveQueryString('code');  // $_GET['code']
$fitbit->handleAuthResponse($code);  // emits obtain-token event
$token = $this->getToken();

echo "My Fitbit access token is: {$token}";
```

### Restoring access
```php
// If token has expired, the first request you make will additionally make a refresh request
$fitbit->setToken(getAccessTokenJsonAsArrayFromMyDatabase());
```

### Making a request

Inspect the FitbitPHPOAuth2 class to find the appropriate method. In this case, I want all activities on a date:
```php
$activities = $fitbit->getActivities('2016-02-20');
print_r($activities);
```
